<h1>Week 8 (Wednesday) - Blender</h1>
<h1>Intro to Blender</h1>
<p>One thing to know about blender is that the interface is notoriously weird.</p>
<p>It’s also very customizable and it’s pretty common to have your own shortcuts and interface customization.</p>
<p>For  now i would stick with the defaults and  try to get them to work for you. It’s a lot easier to find tutorials that news that defaults than other custom shortcuts.</p>

<h2>Interface basics</h2>
<p>After starting Blender and closing the Splash Screen, the Blender window should look similar to the image below.</p>

<p>Blender’s interface is separated into three main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/topbar.html">Topbar</a> at the very top, consists of the main menu,
which is used for saving, importing and exporting files, configuring settings, and rendering among other functions.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/areas.html">Areas</a> in the middle, which is the main workspace</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/interface/window_system/status_bar.html">Status Bar</a> at the bottom,
which displays shortcut suggestions and relevant statistics.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Basic navigation</h2>
<p>To rotate around in the 3D view, hold down the middle mouse button and move the mouse.</p>
<p>To move up and down or to and fro, hold shift+middle mouse, and and move the mouse.</p>
<p>Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.</p>
<p>To select an object left click, to de-select left click away from the object.</p>
<p>To select multiple objects, hold &quot;SHIFT&quot; and select the objects.</p>
<p>To select everything press &quot;A&quot; or to de-select everything press &quot;A&quot;</p>
<p>Notice that when you select something, it will be highlighted orange.</p>
<p>Drag the corner of a window to create a new window</p>
<h1>Object mode and Edit mode</h1>
<p>Blender has many modes but the two most common ones are object mode and edit mode</p>
<p>You can change the mode in the top left corner, or just press TAB.</p>
<p>Object Mode</p>
<p>This lets you select objects and move them around as you please.</p>
<p>Edit Mode</p>
<p>This allows you to select individual vertexes, lines, and planes. you can modify the mesh in this mode.</p>
<h1>Transformations</h1>
<p>In Object mode:</p>
<p><strong>Translating</strong></p>
<p>There are three ways to do this, one is to simple right click and drag. Another is to just select the object and press &quot;G&quot;</p>
<p>Or, you can left click on the axis you want to move the object on, and drag.</p>
<p><strong>Rotating</strong></p>
<p>Rotating is very simple, all you have to do is select the object to be rotated, and press &quot;R&quot;</p>
<p>If you want to rotate around a specific axis, first press &quot;R&quot; then &quot;X&quot;,
&quot;Y&quot;, or &quot;Z&quot;. Each letter corresponds to it's respective axis.</p>
<p><strong>Scaling</strong></p>
<p>To scale an object, simply press &quot;S&quot;. if you want to stretch an object
along a certain axis press &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, or &quot;Z&quot;, after pressing &quot;S&quot;</p>
<h1>Basic Modeling</h1>

<p>to add a mesh, go to the &quot;Add&quot; menu, from there you will find many sub menus, the top one being &quot;Mesh&quot;.</p>
<p>In edit mode there are three ways to select things, you can either select individual vertexes, lines or planes.</p>
<p>To switch, click the three buttons at the top left.</p>
<p><img src="Week%208%20(Wednesday)%20-%20Blender%20d5959c114c0c448fafe62ff54d530967/Untitled%202.png" alt="Untitled"></p>
<h2>Merging</h2>
<p>In edit mode you can select two or more vertexes, and merge them together.</p>
<p>To do this, go into edit mode, select the vertexes you want to merge, press &quot;M&quot;, then, merge.</p>
<h2>Extruding</h2>
<p>In edit mode, you can select a line, vertex, or plane, and extrude, or, extend it.</p>
<p>to do this, select the thing you want to extrude, then press &quot;E&quot;</p>
<h2>Cuts</h2>
<p>This allows you to make a &quot;cut&quot; in a mesh, letting modify it further.</p>
<p>to do this, press &quot;CTR+R&quot; and select the spot you want to cut, then it will allow you to slide that cut, then place it.</p>
<p>This is handy when you want to extrude only a certain part of a plane.</p>
