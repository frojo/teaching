üö® HELP! My game is broken and unfinished, and I need **you** to fix it!
</aside>
<p>My computer crashed and I lost all my work! My game is unfinished and broken. Can you fix it and get it working again? Even better, could you improve it too?</p>

<p>Luckily I made a build of the game before my computer crashed, and uploaded it here: <a href="https://frojo.itch.io/working-game">https://frojo.itch.io/working-game</a></p>
<p>That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like without the bugs!</p>
<p>And here‚Äôs all my assets, including all the scripts and the scene:</p>

<p>You'll notice a lot is broke. You'll need to fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some code in the scripts, 2 out of the 3 have mistakes in them</li>
<li>Some problems in the scene itself. Look at everything in the Inspector</li>
<li>Some problems with the assets themselves too maybe</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you get it working again, you might notice that it's not very good and sort of boring. These were just placeholder assets, I was going to improve all the art before my computer crashed. Could you... add your own art and theme? Embellish the scene using all the things we've learned so far?</p>
<p>Improve the game in at least two ways, including adding an element of juice.</p>
<p>(‚ÄùImproving‚Äù is up to your definiton)</p>
<p>Thanks a lot, I really appreciate your help with this.</p>
<p>Upload your working build on Itch.io, and submit it on <a href="https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1523095/assignments/8408020">Canvas</a></p>
