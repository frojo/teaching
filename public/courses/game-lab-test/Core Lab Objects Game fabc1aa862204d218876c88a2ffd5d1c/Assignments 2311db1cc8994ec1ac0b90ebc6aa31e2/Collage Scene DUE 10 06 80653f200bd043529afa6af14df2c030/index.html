<ul>
<li>All your assets must come from a public domain collection, <strong>do not</strong> use google image search. Some places to get started:

<li>You can edit and embellish the assets you find in Krita, but don't add too much of your own original illustration</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?</em>, Richard Hamilton, 1956</p>
<p>Cutting up existing art to create new work through their juxtaposition is a longstanding technique of modern art!</p>
<p>Think about the original pieces and the context of their creation, and how your new assemblage changes that meaning.</p>

<li>build out to WebGL, upload to <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>, and submit it on Canvas</li>
</ul>
