<h1>Simple Animation | DUE 9/13</h1>
<p>Let's get started using some basic scripts in Unity, by making some sprites and moving them around.</p>
<aside>
▶️ IN UNITY: Create a "poetic landscape" based on a feeling or dream. Position the camera and populate a scene with sprites that move.
</aside>
<ul>
<li>Have at least 5-10 sprites, including scene objects, a background, and the elements that move. You can use physics to make things move, but you must write at least 2 scripts that control something in the scene.</li>
<li><strong>No input or gameplay allowed</strong>, just make a somewhat complex static 3D scene.</li>
<li>build out to WebGL, upload to <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>, and submit it on Canvas</li>
</ul>
