<p>Zines have a long history as creative works of personal expression</p>
<p>You can make a zine about anything! What's something you'd want to tell your peers about?</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://thecreativeindependent.com/guides/how-to-make-a-zine/">How to Make a Zine</a> or <a href="https://zine-machine.glitch.me/">Zine Machine!</a> for some ideas</p>
<p>Here’s *<a href="https://archive.org/browse.php?field=subject&amp;mediatype=texts&amp;collection=zines">a ton* of examples</a> (just check out a few).</p>
<p>(Keep in mind all of these zines are non-interactive. Yours should be <em>interactive</em>!)</p>
<ul>
<li>Use sprites (with found or original artwork), text, and animations. You can also use 3D models if you'd like, and anything else we've learned about so far.</li>
<li>It should feature at least 4 pages of information</li>
<li>build out to WebGL, upload to <a href="http://itch.io">itch.io</a>, and submit it on Canvas</li>
</ul>
<p>Script for changing camera with button</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class ChangeCameraButton : MonoBehaviour
{

    public Camera nextCamera;
  

    public void ChangeCamera() {
        
        // disable the main camera
        Camera.main.enabled = false;
        
        // enable the next camera
        nextCamera.enabled = true;

    }
}
</code></pre>
