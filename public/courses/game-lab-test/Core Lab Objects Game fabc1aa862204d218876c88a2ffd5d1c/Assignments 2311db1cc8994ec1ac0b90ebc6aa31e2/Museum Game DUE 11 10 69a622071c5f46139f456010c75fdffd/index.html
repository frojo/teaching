<h1>Museum Game | DUE 11/10</h1>
<aside>
▶️ IN UNITY: Create your own digital museum!
</aside>
<p>A digital museum is a flexible format. It can be realistic, abstract, fantastical, or metaphorical. It can exhibit real thins, personal things, anything that you'd like. Exhibits can be anything, 3D or 2D.</p>
<p>What makes it a museum is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are curating its contents. The works or objects included are linked through your decision to include them together.</li>
<li>It's an experience that invites visitors in to see the contents. All museums are essentially very expensive zines that you can walk around in.</li>
<li>It's a space visitors decide their route through. Guests form meaning based on how you present a museum's contents. You can guide that experience, but it is ultimately the player's.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<p>This will be a 3D space, navigable in first person (we'll be learning how to do that)</p>
<p>Your museum must include an entry area (somewhere not in the museum where the experience starts), and at least 5 Galleries with exhibits inside</p>
<p>There should be many things to see, read and interpret</p>
<p>Care given to the museum's lighting and sound</p>
<p>The whole museum should take at least 10 minutes to visit</p>
<p>Upload your working build on Itch.io, and submit it on <a href="https://canvas.newschool.edu/courses/1523095/assignments/8408020">Canvas</a></p>
