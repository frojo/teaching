<h1>Week 14 (Wednesday) - Prefabs and instantiation (1)</h1>
<h1>Prefabs</h1>
<p>Prefabs in Unity let you store a GameObject as a <em><strong>reusable</strong></em> Asset. The Prefab Asset acts as a template from which you can create new Prefab instances in the Scene.</p>
<h2>How to create a prefab</h2>
<p>To create a Prefab Asset, drag a <strong>GameObject</strong> from the Hierarchy window into the Project window.</p>
<p><a href="Week%206%20(Wednesday)%20-%20More%20UI%20and%20Prefabs%20(1)%20cb9e39f0e94043198b78a0b2025c2492/Screencast_from_09-28-2023_025557_PM.webm">Screencast from 09-28-2023 02:55:57 PM.webm</a></p>
<p>The GameObject, and  all its components and child GameObjects, becomes a new Asset in your Project window.</p>
<h2>Using prefabs to keep copies in sync</h2>
<p>When you want to reuse a GameObject configured in a particular way – like a non-player character (NPC), prop or piece of scenery – in many places in your Project, you should convert it to a Prefab. This is better than simply copying and pasting the GameObject, because the Prefab system allows you to automatically keep all the copies in sync.</p>

<p>Any edits that you make to a Prefab Asset are automatically reflected in the instances of that Prefab, allowing you to easily make broad changes across your whole Project without having to repeatedly make the same edit to every copy of the Asset.</p>
<h1>Instantiation</h1>
<p>You can use <code>Instantiate()</code> to clone gameobjects or prefabs</p>
<h2>Basics of instantiating a Prefab</h2>
<p>To instantiate a Prefab at run time, your code needs a reference to that Prefab. You can make this reference by creating a public variable in your code to hold the Prefab reference. The public variable in your code appears as an assignable field in the Inspector. You can then assign the actual Prefab you want to use in the Inspector.</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using UnityEngine;
public class InstantiationExample : MonoBehaviour 
{
    // Reference to the Prefab. Drag a Prefab into this field in the Inspector.
    public GameObject myPrefab;

    // This script will simply instantiate the Prefab when the game starts.
    void Start()
    {
        // Instantiate at position (0, 0, 0) and zero rotation.
        Instantiate(myPrefab, new Vector3(0, 0, 0), Quaternion.identity);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When to use a prefab:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building a structure out of a single Prefab by replicating it
multiple times in different positions, for example in a grid or circle
formation.</li>
<li>Firing a projectile Prefab from a launcher. The projectile Prefab could be a complex configuration containing a <strong>Mesh</strong>, <strong>Rigidbody</strong>, <strong>Collider</strong>, <strong>AudioSource</strong>, <strong>Dynamic Light</strong>, and a child GameObject with its own trail <strong>Particle System</strong>.</li>
<li>A vehicle, building or character, for example a robot, breaking
apart into many pieces. In this scenario, the example script deletes and replaces the complete, operational robot Prefab with a wrecked robot
Prefab. This wrecked Prefab consists of separate broken parts of the
robot, each set up with Rigidbodies and Particle Systems of their own.
This technique allows you to blow up a robot into many pieces, with just one line of code, which replaces the original GameObject with a wrecked Prefab.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Creating a structure instantaneously</h2>
<p>This code will use a block gameobject to create a wall</p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using UnityEngine;
public class Wall : MonoBehaviour
{
   public GameObject block;
   public int width = 10;
   public int height = 4;
  
   void Start()
   {
       for (int y=0; y&lt;height; ++y)
       {
           for (int x=0; x&lt;width; ++x)
           {
               Instantiate(block, new Vector3(x,y,0), Quaternion.identity);
           }
       }       
   }
}
</code></pre>
