# fran's personal website

4th time is the charm

basically copying the framework from https://github.com/boshis-place/wonderville-projects/tree/main/src


how to update website on my digital ocean droplet:

and now on the droplet...
`ssh root@165.227.199.25` (pw is unsurprising)
`git pull` in `personal`

and that should work
