	<h1>Intro. to PICO-8: The joy of working with limitations</h1>
    	<p>For <a href="https://processing.nyc/2020/">Processing Community Day NYC 2020</a>, I gave a short overview of <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a>, a game-making tool for making small videogames. I wanted to introduce PICO-8 to the Processing community and explore if there was anything we could learn from its limitations-celebrating design.</p>
