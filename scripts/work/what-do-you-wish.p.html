      <h1>what do you wish you could say?</h1>
      <p>Created for the <a href="https://sfpc.io/">School of Poetic Computation</a> Fall 2019 showcase.</p>
      <p>A closet in the exhibit space was turned into a cozy, alternate space that someone could hang out in to momentarily escape the exhibition. Participants were let in one a time and were invited to take as much time as they wanted in the room, and to write down a secret on a piece of paper before leaving. By the end of the showcase, the room was full of secrets.</p>

      <p>Materials: lightbulbs from Canal Lighting & Parts, shelves, a bean bag, speakers, a couple of Arduinos, LEDs, paper</p>
