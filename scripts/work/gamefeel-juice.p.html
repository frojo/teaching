<h1>Gamefeel/Juice lecture</h1>
<p>In Fall 2021, I gave a lecture on gamefeel and juice to undergraduates in the Intermediate for Game Development class (taught by Karina Popp) at NYU Game Center.

<p>The lecture consisted of two parts: a theory section and a hands-on section.</p>

<p> I prepared some <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LM_ch-NtIlEJu10MeQNV5VTnlfvwIEBpT7yYC2g5Ksk/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/frojo/strongcat">small toy project</a> for students to implement some screenshake and hitstop.</p>
