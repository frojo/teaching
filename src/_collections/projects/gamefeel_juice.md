Gamefeel/Juice lecture
======================

In Fall 2021, I gave a lecture on gamefeel and juice to undergraduates in the Intermediate for Game Development class (taught by Karina Popp) at NYU Game Center.

The lecture consisted of two parts: a theory section and a hands-on section.

I prepared some [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LM_ch-NtIlEJu10MeQNV5VTnlfvwIEBpT7yYC2g5Ksk/edit?usp=sharing) and a [small toy project](https://github.com/frojo/strongcat) for students to implement some screenshake and hitstop.
