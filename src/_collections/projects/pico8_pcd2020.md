Intro. to PICO-8: The joy of working with limitations

For [Processing Community Day NYC 2020](https://processing.nyc/2020/), I gave a short overview of [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), a game-making tool for making small videogames. I wanted to introduce PICO-8 to the Processing community and explore if there was anything we could learn from its limitations-celebrating design.
