what do you wish you could say?
===============================

Created for the [School of Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.io/) Fall 2019 showcase.

A closet in the exhibit space was turned into a cozy, alternate space that someone could hang out in to momentarily escape the exhibition. Participants were let in one a time and were invited to take as much time as they wanted in the room, and to write down a secret on a piece of paper before leaving. By the end of the showcase, the room was full of secrets.

[Allison Chan](https://allisonchan.info/) made the sign with the beautiful lettering on the door.

Materials: lightbulbs from Canal Lighting & Parts, shelves, a bean bag, speakers, a couple of Arduinos, LEDs, paper
