Godot workshop for Babycastles Academy
======================================

Godot is a great [open-source game engine](https://godotengine.org/) . As part of Babycastles Academy (an amazing series of workshops put on by [Babycastles](https://www.babycastles.com/)), I streamed an introduction to Godot.
